		 * # lines or block of code used to perform specific task in the program.
		 * # In Java, there are no stand alone functions. Every function must be associated with a class,
		 *  and therefore, they are referred to as methods. Java does not have "free functions" like in some other languages.
		 * #Syntax:
		 * 		returnType methodName(arg1,arg2,.....argn)
		 * {
		 *  // statements..
		 * }
		 * 
		 * # return_type:
		 * 		a. void			:		no value(result) return from method. 
		 *		b. non-void		:		value(result) return from method.
